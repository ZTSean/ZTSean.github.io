## Introduction

This is the demo for the idea which focus on deteting the depth between 3D objects and pen. Horizontal and vertical planes and red indication line start from pen will indicate the distance from the pen to the object surface according to current eye direction(camera direction). Keyboard and mouse control will help user to manipulate this demo and those are also simulation for the pen in 3D painting.

## Installation

1. Processing 2.0+
2. Install Obsessive Camera Direction (OCD) lib or Processing
3. Click run button on Processing

## Keyboard and Mouse Control Instruction

W -- move pen forward  
S -- move pen backward  
A -- move pen left  
D -- move pen right  
Q -- move pen up  
E -- move pen down  
Z -- zoom in  
C -- zoom out  
P -- turn on or off Planes  
L -- turn on or off indication line  
Right Click & move -- rotate camera  
Left Click & move -- move camera  

## Future Implementation
1. More realistic and convient pen simulation through mouse and keyborad  
2. Add functionality: Edit **stroke**  
3. Control pen direction in some specific usage
